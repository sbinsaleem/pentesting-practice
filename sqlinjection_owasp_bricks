The following are some steps to perform SQL Injection using OWASP's bricks website.

1) First go to the following bricks website.

https://sechow.com/bricks/index.html

2) Go to login pages.

http://44.237.85.85/login-pages.html

3) Got to first login page.

http://44.237.85.85/login-1/

4) Give any random username and password on the login page and press enter.

5) You will received an error message of wrong username and password and a query explaining what exactly happening or 
how your browser is talking with the database. Copy that query and paste in any text editor. For example, I found the 
following query.In otherwords, the following is the query sent from the application server into the database. 

SQL Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='motabhai' and password='12345'

6) Now, replace a username with any random username and write any statement in the password to make it run. Normally, we put any SQL statment which is 
always true. For example, we can write inside the password field '1'='1' which is always true.This will shape the query in the following way.

SQL Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='tom' and password='1' or '1=1 --'

7) Now, copy and paste this payload in the username and password fields of the login page 1. 

8) The login is a success. By the way, you can find various sql injections payload in the Kali Linux directory "/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/Injections".

9)Now on the same login page, give any username and password parameters and intercept the request with the help of Burp Suite. 

10) After this, paste the request in a file.

11) Now, use the sqlmap query "sqlmap -r filename -p username". "-p is the parameter. we are providing username as the parameter". 

12) WE have found a lot of useful information using this sqlmap query / command e.g. the backend database is MySQL. The number of injectionable points with total
number of 423 HTTP requests. This all information is useful and further we can get more data.

13) The following are links for learning more about SQL Injection and to watch the tutorials.
